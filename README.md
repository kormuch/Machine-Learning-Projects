My Machine Learning Algorithm Projects
This repository is a (very small) collection of programs that demonstrate my approach to studying and understanding machine learning algorithms by building them from scratch. I used those projects in preparation for my Machine Learning Exam at IU International University (and I passed with 1.3 or A-) Each project represents a hands-on exercise in translating complex theory into functioning code.

This repository currently includes:

Genetic Algorithm: A program designed to optimize a "sandwich" based on health and popularity scores. This project was a deep dive into the practical application of evolutionary algorithms.

Decision Tree Model: A project focused on building a decision tree from the ground up to understand its core mechanics and how it makes predictions about fruits.

Support Vector Machines: A very simple SVM algorithm with 6 datapoints so it could also (technically) be calculated by hand.

Feel free to explore the code and documentation to see my learning journey.
